# Logs Schema Support

Observability refers to the ability to monitor and diagnose systems and applications in real-time, in order to understand how they are behaving and identify potential issues.
logs serve as a primary source of information for understanding and debugging complex systems.
Logs provide a record of events, errors, and performance that help developers and administrators identify and resolve issues, monitor system behavior, and improve reliability.

Logs can also be used to gain insight into user behavior and facilitate auditing and compliance.
By analyzing logs, one can detect patterns, anomalies, and correlations that can inform decisions and facilitate problem-solving. 
Logs help to ensure the visibility, reliability, and stability of systems.

## Details
The next section provides the Simple Schema for Observability support which conforms with the OTEL specification.

- logs.mapping presents the template mapping for creating the Simple Schema for Observability index
- logs.schema presents the json schema validation for verification of a metrics document conforms to the mapping structure

## Logs
see [OTEL Logs convention](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md)
see [OTEL logs protobuf](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/tree/main/opentelemetry/proto/logs/v1)

Simple Schema for Observability conforms with OTEL logs protocol which defines the next data model:

## General Fields
     
### Event Fields
Within a particular domain, the ```event.name``` attribute identifies the event. Events with same domain and name are structurally similar to one another.
For example, some domains could have well-defined schema for their events based on event names. (OTEL driven)

`event.kind` gives high-level information about what type of information the event contains, without being specific to the contents of the event.(ECS driven)
**Possible values**
 - alert
 - enrichment
 - event
 - metric
 - state
 - pipeline_error
 - signal

The `event.domain` attribute is used to logically separate events from different systems. For example, to record Events from `browser` apps, `mobile` apps and `Kubernetes`, we could use browser, device and k8s as the domain for their Events.
This provides a clean separation of semantics for events in each of the domains. (OTEL driven)

`event.category` gives categorical-level information about what type of information the event contains, this field is an array. (ECS driven)
**Possible values**
   - authentication
   - configuration
   - database
   - driver
   - email
   - file
   - host
   - iam
   - intrusion_detection
   - malware
   - network
   - package
   - process
   - registry
   - session
   - threat
   - vulnerability
   - web

`event.category` corresponds with  `event.domain`

`event.type` gives a fine grain details of the event's category including the phase in-which the field is part of.
This will allow proper categorization of some events that fall in multiple event types, this field is an array. (ECS driven)

**Possible values**
  - access
  - admin
  - allowed
  - change
  - connection
  - creation
  - deletion
  - denied
  - end
  - error
  - group
  - indicator
  - info
  - installation
  - protocol
  - start
  - user


`event.result` gives a success or a failure indication from the perspective of the entity that produced the event. (ECS driven)

**Possible values**

 - failure
 - success
 - pending
 - undetermined


#### Exception Fields
This field encapsulated the exception that should appear under the event section `event.exception` (OTEL driven)

 - `message`: The exception message.
 - `stacktrace`: A stacktrace as a string in the natural representation for the language runtime. The representation is to be determined and documented by each language SIG.
 - `type`: The type of the exception (its fully-qualified class name, if applicable). The dynamic type of the exception should be preferred over the static type in languages that support it.

### Overview

In observability, Logs are typically unstructured data that is generated by applications or systems as a record of events or messages.
Logs can contain any information that the emitting application or system wants to include, and they often contain free-form text rather than structured data.
This makes logs difficult to process and analyze automatically, but it also provides a lot of flexibility and versatility in terms of what information can be captured.

According to [ECS](https://github.com/elastic/ecs) and the most recent (experimental) [OTEL](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions) definitions, we formalized a unified
log schema. This schema can be used for working with a well-structured set of typed logs arriving from categorical sources.
These sources are expected to report information in a specific way that will simplify future correlations and consolidate similar concerns.

### Setting Up the Logs Mapping
Start the OpenSearch cluster and follow the next steps for manually setup of the Log mapping template:

`>> PUT _component_template/http_template`

Copy the http.mapping content [here](http.mapping)

`>> PUT _component_template/communication_template`

Copy the communication.mapping content [here](communication.mapping)

`>> PUT _index_template/logs`

Copy the logs.mapping content [here](logs.mapping)

Now you can create an index (following the logs index pattern) that has the supported schema:

`>> PUT /sso_logs-dataset-test1`
